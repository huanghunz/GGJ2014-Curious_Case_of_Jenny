GGJ2014-Curious_Case_of_Jenny
=============================

It’s a 2-day project created in GGJ2014 by a team of 5. 
It’s the first time I coded with JavaScript in a game engine that none of the teammate had experience with it.


Control:
Use arrow key to control the boy character.
Use WASD to control the adult character.

Finding hints and car-keys by searching the house. Drive the car and save Jenny!
